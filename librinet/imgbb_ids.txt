Prompt: "A meticulously arranged studio composition features three glazed chestnuts nestled closely together, their glossy surfaces reflecting soft, diffused lighting. One chestnut, partially opened, invites admiration by revealing its tender interior. The absence of stems emphasizes the smooth, rounded forms of the marron glacés, characterized by their slightly creased exteriors and rich, opaque sugar glaze. Set against a pristine white backdrop, this high-resolution image captures the intricate details of each chestnut, the gentle blurring around the edges softly accentuating their textures and colors. Emphasizing a professional food photography aesthetic, the clean and minimalist arrangement highlights the natural elegance of this gourmet treat, evoking a sense of refined indulgence.

Studio shot of three glazed chestnuts arranged side by side, one touching the other. One is slightly opened to reveal the inside. No stems or stalks are visible. Marron glacés are not shiny, they are vaguely round and with visible creases on the surface, they have a rich glaze of opaque solidified sugar coating. Isolated against a perfectly white background. The soft, diffused lighting, high resolution, and shallow depth of field gently blur the edges and highlight textures and colors. Professional food photography style, clean, minimalist composition.", ImgBB ID: GvCFp5g1/A-meticulously-arranged-studio-composition-features-three-glazed-chestnuts-nestled-closely-together.jpg
